declare description "Polyphonic pitch-LOCK harmonizer: an.pitchTracker detects the tracked signal's own fundamental once per sample, and each held voice's shift is (targetNote - detectedNote), so the wet output always lands on the exact pressed key regardless of what pitch is actually being played -- Infected Mushroom Manipulator style, not a fixed-interval transpose. The shift window is pitch-synchronous (sized from the detected period, like davemollen/dm-Whammy and DawDreamer's own dt_whammy.dsp auto_window), since a fixed window measurably detunes ef.transpose at large shift ratios -- confirmed via DawDreamer: a fixed 10ms window put a +22-semitone lock ~114 cents flat, while pitch-synchronous sizing holds every tested shift within a few cents. free crossfades the tracked/shifted source between dry (free=0) and loopSum (free=1), and routes the single shared wet bus to the matching output (dryWet/loopWet) -- so SHIFT-held polyphonic keyplay locks the loops instead of the live input, with no second pitch-tracker/voice bank. trackPitchHz reimplements an.pitchTracker's zero-crossing/adaptive-lowpass loop locally with two broadband zero-crossing floors on the adaptive cutoff (coarseTrackerTau=3ms halved, fastTrackerTau=1.5ms at 0.8x, both taken via max() against the main tracker's own recursive state, never replacing it): the stock function's cutoff is bounded only by a hardcoded 20Hz and its own zero-initialized recursive state, so after silence a fresh attack's cutoff has to crawl up from that floor over hundreds of ms, starving the filter of the true fundamental and reading far too low -- since shiftAmount is targetNote-detNote, an under-read detNote inflates the locked output sharp for the whole crawl, audible as a slide down into the held key. WITNESSED via the DawDreamer JIT harness: a fresh 196Hz attack read ~20 semitones sharp for ~250ms before dropping to the true pitch (original 3ms-only floor); a real CI DawDreamer run at 880-1318Hz found the 3ms-only floor still left a real ~200-cent mean sharp bias in the first 35-100ms at those higher octaves. A diagnostic run isolating the floor estimator alone (test/pitch-tracker-transient/diag_isolate_floor.py, no main lowpass loop) found the fast floor already converges close to true pitch at 880/1318Hz on its own (within ~5% by 35ms) but the original *.5 halving (meant to stop a transient's own broadband noise from spuriously pushing the floor an octave high) was suppressing that accurate high-frequency reading down to roughly half its true value -- widened fastHz's multiplier to *.8 (still a real safety margin below the raw estimate, just less aggressive than the coarse 3ms floor's *.5, which keeps its own halving since it has the documented broadband-noise history) to let the accurate fast estimate actually reach the cutoff floor instead of being halved into irrelevance.";
