# Controls — the real, current control surface

The control surface is implemented in `src/control/apc_grid.cpp` and driven by
an APC Key25-class MIDI grid controller. Every binding still goes through the
same name-keyed `ParamStore`/Faust-zone mechanism the project started with —
re-mapping a CC or note is a config change, not a recompile — but the gestures
each pad/knob drives have grown well past plain rec/play/vol. This document is
the user-facing summary; `AGENTS.md`'s "Control Surface" section has the
byte-level detail and the bug history behind each rule below.

## Looper pads: a real press cycle, not a toggle

Each looper pad drives one of 20 independent loopers through a state cycle,
not a simple record/play flag:

```
empty → ARM (rec=1, held) → FINISH (rec=0, play=1) → pause (play=0) → resume (play=1) → ...
```

- **ARM and FINISH fire on press**, not release — both are instants that must
  land precisely.
- **Long-hold erases** a looper's content and, if it was the last looper still
  holding content, resets the shared master phrase length so the next
  recording re-establishes it from scratch.
- **CLEAR_ALL** zeroes every looper's `play` and `rec` in one gesture.
- Real APC Key25 hardware re-sends note-on for an already-held pad; a press
  guard treats the repeat as a no-op so it can't reset a hold timer or
  re-trigger ARM/FINISH mid-recording.
- **Successive recordings snap to a musical subdivision** of the first
  recording's real length — the master phrase length is read from live
  `writeIdx` telemetry (sample-accurate), never estimated from wall-clock time.
  Candidates are always powers of 2 relative to the established length, chosen
  by the log-space geometric midpoint between the two bracketing candidates —
  so any two loopers' lengths are always in a clean power-of-2 ratio and stay
  drift-free forever.

## Guitar-FX held: sidechain-source toggle

While the Guitar-FX pad is held, a looper-pad press is redirected entirely — it
toggles that looper as a sidechain-pump source instead of touching its
ARM/FINISH state. The designation auto-clears when that looper's content is
wiped.

## The LofiFx / granulator pad: two gestures on one button

This pad (note 69) always switches the active knob bank to LofiFx and always
fires instantly on the press edge — SHIFT disambiguates which of the two
gestures below fires, never a hold-duration timer (a prior 1000ms-hold design
was witnessed unreliable on real hardware — real button releases interrupted
the hold before the threshold, so Resonode never actually engaged):

- **Plain tap**: flips a *latched* granulator state the instant the pad goes
  down. This turns the grain engine into a persistent, backgrounded texture
  layered under everything else; a second plain tap flips it back off. The
  latch survives release regardless of how long the press turns out to last.
- **SHIFT + tap**: toggles the instrument entirely into/out of **Resonode**, a
  4-voice, 6-mode-per-voice coupled modal-resonator synth in the spirit of a
  classic hardware physical-modeling instrument. While engaged:
  - The keybed drives up to 4 Resonode voices (round-robin/oldest-steal
    allocation, same shape as the pitch-lock voice allocator below), each
    carrying its own real MIDI velocity into the exciter's gain — a harder
    key press rings out louder.
  - Knob slots 1–4 are the blend weight of one of 4 named material patches —
    **Percussive, Metal/Glass, Strings, Dance Bass** — each a full point
    in position/decay/damping/stretch/collision space, blended as a convex
    combination exactly like the granulator's own patch surface below. Knob
    slots 5–7 are direct performative dials: **tone** (exponential-taper
    brightness), **level** (output loudness), and **couple** (nearest-neighbor
    energy exchange between adjacent modes — 0 is the original independent-
    mode behavior, higher values let modes audibly interact/beat rather than
    ring in isolation, the single biggest lever for making two patches feel
    distinct from each other rather than variations on one tone).
  - Resonode is excited by the *live input signal* ("reactor mode"), not a
    synthetic oscillator — it only sounds through a voice while that voice's
    key is held (silent input still renders bit-exact silence), and it fully
    **replaces** the dry/pitch-lock signal while engaged rather than layering
    under it. The exciter itself is broadband (each of the 6 modes performs
    its own frequency selection, rather than a shared note-locked filter
    pre-narrowing what reaches the bank) and shaped by a percussive strike
    envelope — a fast attack that decays to a low sustain floor while the key
    stays held, so a keypress reads as a struck-object transient rather than
    continuously re-opening a high-Q filter on whatever the mic is currently
    picking up.
  - A harder key press also bends the pitch briefly upward on attack before
    settling to the true note — more so on "flexible" (low-dispersion)
    patches, barely at all on "stiff" (high-dispersion) ones — and
    **collision** adds a bounded per-patch soft-clip "bounce" to each voice's
    own output (0 = untouched passthrough), both scaled per named patch
    rather than exposed as free-standing knobs. Each voice also gets a small
    live spectral drift (brighter right at the strike, settling back to the
    patch's own tone over the next third of a second) and a small per-note
    random micro-variation, so a single patch audibly evolves within a note
    and no two strikes of the same key sound identically static.
  - The knob bank latches on LofiFx permanently on press, matching Dub/Guitar
    (no revert-on-release) — Resonode itself stays engaged until a further
    SHIFT+tap toggles it back off, and disengaging releases every held
    Resonode voice.

LED feedback on the pad itself: blinking red once Resonode is actually
engaged, solid green while the granulator is latched-on in the background,
off otherwise.

### Granulator and Resonode: named patches, blended, never raw sliders

When Resonode is *not* engaged, knob slots 1–6 are the blend weight of one of
6 fixed named grain patches — **Glass, Cloud, Freeze, Chop, Tape, Shatter** —
each a full point in grain-size/density/pitch-spray/position-jitter/scan-rate/
reverse-probability/envelope-shape space representing a distinct musical
character. When Resonode *is* engaged, knob slots 1–4 blend the 4 named
material patches above instead. Both surfaces share the same convex-
combination discipline: turning up multiple patch dials together produces a
coherent blend, never independent raw parameters fighting each other, and all
weights at zero falls back to the first named patch (Glass for the granulator,
Percussive for Resonode) rather than dividing by zero. Real key velocity
scales overall voice loudness for both instruments, and (for granular voices
only) grain spawn density, so a harder key press plays louder — and for the
granulator, spawns a denser, brighter grain cloud.

## 6-voice polyphonic pitch-lock (SHIFT + keybed)

Holding SHIFT and pressing keys drives a 6-voice polyphonic pitch-lock engine
(`multitranspose.dsp`) — a Whammy/Manipulator-style harmonizer where the
output lands on the exact held key regardless of the input's actual pitch.

- Each held key claims one of 6 voice slots (reuse-own-slot / prefer-unheld /
  oldest-steal allocation).
- The transpose window is pitch-synchronous (sized from the detected input
  period, capped at 20ms), not a fixed window, so large shifts track
  correctly and rapid retriggers stay click-safe.
- SHIFT alone (no key held) is a separate gesture — the native fold mechanism
  that lets the previous block's loop content bleed into the live input.
- SHIFT + `fx/monitorfold`'s **free-transpose** mode redirects the whole
  tracking/shifting engine onto the loop content itself instead of the dry
  input — a live "pitch-shift the loop" gesture on the same voice engine.
- Locked pitch **replaces** the original signal — a dry/pitch-lock crossfade
  gate closes as voices gate, so this is a lock, never a harmonizer sitting on
  top of the unshifted signal.

## Grid-beat visualization

The 4 top-right otherwise-unassigned pads show the shared 16-beat Link phrase
position live, read from `AudioThread::Telemetry::gridBeatIndex`. Each pad is
one quarter of the 16-beat phrase. Dark when nothing is playing; green
whenever any looper is playing; a quarter already passed turns yellow; the
red position marker cycles across the 4 pads once per beat, landing on the
pad matching the current position within the active quarter.

## 3-bank FX knob surface

The knob row is one shared set of 8 CCs — {48, 49, 50, 51, 54, 55, 57, 53},
with CC53 double-duty as Formant on the Dub page — whose target table depends
on which bank is active — **Dub**, **Guitar**, or **LofiFx**
(granulator/Resonode, above).
A bank-select press only flips which target table the next knob CC reaches
and starts a brief LED flash; it never re-pushes state to the DSP.

## Config-file remapping (unchanged mechanism)

Every control still ultimately binds through `/etc/aloop-controls.conf` (see
`config/controls.conf` for the format): a plain `<midi> <target>` line per
binding, parsed by the MIDI thread and written into the name-keyed
`ParamStore`, which the audio thread reads by name into the matching Faust
control zone. Nothing is hardcoded — the map is the single source of truth for
which physical control reaches which target, and re-mapping needs no
recompile. What has changed since this file's original scope is the *behavior*
layered on top of individual pads (the gestures documented above) — the
underlying binding mechanism is untouched.
