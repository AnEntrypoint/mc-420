# aloop architecture

This document explains **how aloop is structured and why** — every design choice
here traces to a witnessed finding in [`FEASIBILITY.md`](FEASIBILITY.md). Read
that first if you want the raw evidence; this is the distilled architecture.

## Design principle: keep the good bare-metal ideas, delete the hand-rolled ones

The bare-metal looper got the *hard* things right — a lock-free 4-core audio
architecture with no mutexes in the audio path — and got the *tedious* things
wrong-then-painfully-fixed (a hand-rolled USB-audio decoder, a hand-rolled WiFi
+ DHCP + ARP + Ableton-Link wire stack). aloop **keeps the architecture and
deletes the reimplementations**, replacing each with the tested kernel/userspace
equivalent.

## The 4-core partition

The Pi 4 has four cores. aloop assigns them exactly as the bare-metal looper did
(`multicore.cpp:10-34`), because that partition already works and already keeps
the audio core clean:

| Core | Role | Bare-metal origin | aloop mechanism |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **0** | USB audio I/O | USB completion ISR + dispatch | kernel `f_uac2` gadget IRQ + ALSA |
| **1** | **home-FX DSP** | audio DSP worker (`AudioSystem::doUpdate`) | RT thread, `SCHED_FIFO`, pinned |
| **3** | **user-FX DSP** | *idle / reserved* | RT thread, `SCHED_FIFO`, pinned — **now used** |
| **2** | control | net / MIDI / Link / WiFi | Ableton Link lib, `hostapd`/`wpa_supplicant`, ALSA MIDI, telemetry |

The single new thing: **Core 3, which sat idle on bare metal, now runs the
user's swappable effect.** That's where the "add your own effect on the free
core" goal lands.

### Why network/WiFi lives on Core 2, not the audio cores

Ableton Link and WiFi generate interrupts and CPU load. If they landed on the
audio core they would blow the 1.333 ms per-block deadline and cause audible
xruns. By pinning all network work to Core 2 and using `isolcpus` +
`/proc/irq/*/smp_affinity` to steer WiFi/network IRQs *off* the audio cores, the
audio cores meet their deadline regardless of network activity. (This is
achievable on Pi 4; see the Pi-5 caveat in `FEASIBILITY.md`.)

## The audio path: Faust, lock-free, allocation-free

The audio DSP — the loop engine (`dsp/loop.dsp`) and the effects (the dubfx Faust
chain) — is **Faust**, composed into one home-FX program (`dsp/aloop.dsp`) that
Faust compiles to allocation-free C++. It contains no Circle/looper source; it
reproduces the looper's behavior natively. (The paragraph below describes the
lock-free control→audio handoff that the Faust program's param inputs use.)

The former note about a ported C++ DSP core no longer applies —
**no dependency on Circle** and does **no allocation, locking, or syscalls in the
audio callback**. That's why it ports to Linux unchanged: it drops onto a Linux
`SCHED_FIFO` audio thread exactly as it sat on a bare-metal core. The dubfx
project already proved the effects compile standalone and produce
sample-identical output.

Control parameters (Link tempo/phase, MIDI knob values) reach the audio thread
through the same **double-buffered atomic snapshot** the looper used
(`paramSnapshot.h`): a single writer on the control core fills an inactive buffer
and flips an index; the audio thread reads the active buffer. No locks, no
tearing, no priority inversion. On Linux the cross-core wakeup primitive changes
from bare-metal `SEV`/`WFE` to a `futex`/`eventfd`, but the lock-free discipline
is identical.

## Effects topology: Faust home stack in-binary + dynamic user LV2s in-process

This is the load-bearing decision, and it exists to satisfy two goals at once —
**hot-swappable effects** *and* **zero added latency**.

### Home effects = the Faust home stack, compiled INTO the binary

The home-FX chain is the Faust program `dsp/aloop.dsp` (`loop : effects_runtime` —
the loop engine composed with the dubfx effect chain). It is compiled to C++ and
linked into the `aloop` binary; the audio thread runs it directly as `faustHome`
each block (Core 1). It is **not** dynamically loaded — there is no home LV2 to
find at boot, so there is nothing to name-mismatch.
- `faust2lv2` also packages that *same* home stack as an `aloop.lv2` bundle
  (`build-lv2`) — that bundle is the alternative, drop-into-another-host packaging
  and the A/B artifact, **not** what the aloop binary loads.

### User effects = dynamic LV2, hosted in-process

A user drops their own `.lv2` bundle into `user_dir` (`/effects/user`) on flash and
the audio thread's in-process host loads it **by directory** (any `*.lv2` present)
onto the free core (Core 3) — no recompile, no firmware flash. This is the
moddability the whole project is for. LV2 gives the standard plugin ABI
(`instantiate` / `connect_port` / `run`) + `.ttl` metadata. The effect dirs come
from `aloop.conf [effects]` (`home_dir` / `user_dir`), never hardcoded.

### Why *in-process*, and never a JACK/PipeWire graph

The obvious way to run two plugins on two cores is a graph host (JACK2/PipeWire
run each client on its own core). **aloop deliberately does not do this.** A
graph host schedules clients across period boundaries, which adds **one full
audio period (1.333 ms) of latency per hop**. That violates the no-added-latency
goal.

Instead, aloop `dlopen`s the LV2 bundles and calls their `run()` **directly
inside its own audio callback**. The witnessed latency arithmetic
(`FEASIBILITY.md`, Requirement 3) shows why this is enough:

| Topology | Parallel across cores? | Added latency |
|----------|:---:|:---:|
| Serial chain, in-process, one core | ✗ | **0 ms** |
| Parallel FX, fork-join across two cores | ✓ | **0 ms** |
| JACK/PipeWire graph | ✓ | **+1 period** |

The home + user chain (~0.9 ms of work) **fits inside one 1.333 ms block on a
single core**, so the default is to run it serial in-process — zero added
latency, no cross-core coordination needed. Cross-core fork-join (Core 1 + Core
3 joined within the same block, ~0.51 ms wall) is available for genuinely
*parallel* effects or if the chain ever becomes CPU-bound. **A graph host is
never used.**

### User-plugin crash isolation

A user's LV2 is untrusted code running in the audio process. In-process hosting
means a segfaulting plugin could take down audio — so the host installs a
`SIGSEGV` handler + watchdog that **disables a misbehaving plugin and continues
with the home chain**, degraded rather than dead. (True process isolation would
require a graph and its latency; that tradeoff is documented in `DECISIONS.md`.)

## The home stack has grown into a real instrument, not just loop+effects

Everything below runs inside the same always-on Faust program on Core 1,
alongside the original loop engine and effects chain — Faust has no runtime
branching, so every stage below is computed every block whether or not it is
currently engaged (see `AGENTS.md`'s "Faust has no runtime branching" entry);
this is the accepted cost model here, not a regression to fix.

- **6-voice polyphonic pitch-lock** (`effects/home/faust/multitranspose.dsp`) —
  a pitch tracker plus 6 crossfaded-delay-line shifter voices, each gated by a
  held key. Locked output *replaces* the dry signal via a dedicated gate, it
  never layers over it.
- **Resonode** (`effects/home/faust/resonode_synth.dsp`) — a 4-voice, 6-mode-
  per-voice modal resonator synth excited by the live input signal, with
  velocity-scaled exciter gain, alias-guarded higher modes (a mode above
  Nyquist fades to silence rather than folding back into an unrelated
  frequency), and click-free voice stealing (a stolen voice gets a synthetic
  one-sample gate dip to re-trigger its envelopes, plus a frequency-glide to
  avoid a biquad-coefficient discontinuity).
- **The granulator** lives in `Sampler` (C++, not Faust — it needs dynamic
  grain scheduling that doesn't fit Faust's static dataflow model), sharing the
  same post-fx capture tap as loop recording.

These are genuinely *new* instrument capabilities, not ports of anything the
original bare-metal looper had — see `docs/MIGRATION-MAP.md` for which parts of
this codebase are Circle ports versus net-new.

## Ableton Link: the official library, RT-safe by the same pattern

The bare-metal looper reimplemented the Link wire protocol from scratch because
it had no IP stack. Linux has one, so aloop uses the **official Ableton Link
library** over ordinary UDP multicast. Link's design already matches the
looper's: its network thread runs on the control core; the audio thread reads
the session state through the RT-safe `captureAudioSessionState` /
snapshot boundary. WiFi jitter therefore degrades Link *sync accuracy*, never the
audio deadline.

## WiFi: STA when there's a network, AP when there isn't (autoAP)

The Pi tries to join a known network (station mode); if none is available it
hosts its own access point so peer devices can still discover it for Link. This
is *mode-switching*, not simultaneous AP+STA (which is flaky on a single Pi
radio). `wpa_supplicant` + `hostapd` + `dnsmasq` under OpenRC, with a switch
service — the exact behavior the looper hand-rolled, now on the tested stack.
The AP passes multicast between clients (`ap_isolate=0`) so Link works over it.

## Mesh networking: aloop + esp-idf-link form one ad-hoc Link mesh

Ableton Link's peer discovery is UDP multicast, so every device that should
share tempo/transport needs to be on the same L2 network. aloop pairs with a
sibling ESP32-based project (`../esp-idf-link`, the "ticker" box) to form
**one ad-hoc, single-AP mesh** with no credential provisioning: exactly one
device hosts an open SSID (`ticker`), and everyone else joins as a station.

- **Host election is MAC-ordered**, not "host if nothing was found" — both
  projects hold for a duration monotonic in their own MAC address (lowest
  MAC ≈ 0s, highest ≈ 6s) before deciding to host, rescanning every second and
  joining the instant a peer's AP appears. This avoids the failure mode where
  two devices cold-booting together each scan before the other's AP exists and
  both end up hosting, splitting into two isolated L2 domains Link can never
  cross.
- Every AP/channel/Link-quantum/start-stop-sync value is a **paired invariant**
  between the two codebases — changing one without the other silently breaks
  meshing with no error on either side. `AGENTS.md`'s Mesh Networking section
  carries the authoritative paired-invariant table.
- Link's own tempo-authority rule (a peer joining must never hijack the
  session's tempo) is audited against Ableton's own 12-case Link Test Plan,
  not just informally — see `AGENTS.md`'s "Ableton's Link Test Plan" entry.

Whether Link's multicast crosses the Pi's own AP to its stations on the
Broadcom WiFi chip (`ap_isolate=0` may or may not be sufficient alone) is
currently **unverified on real hardware** — see `docs/LINK-MESH-TESTING.md`.

## USB audio: the kernel `f_uac2` gadget

The Pi presents itself *as* a USB audio device (a UAC2 gadget) so a host computer
sees it as a soundcard. The bare-metal looper hand-wrote this, and every
buzz/crackle bug in its history came from that code. aloop uses the Linux
**`f_uac2` configfs gadget** on the `dwc2` controller — the kernel lays out the
isochronous USB packets correctly by construction, deleting that entire class of
bug. This is the hardest single port, but it removes the most maintenance.

## Boot to appliance

Alpine boots **diskless from RAM** with a read-only root and only the services
aloop needs (the audio binary, `hostapd`/`wpa_supplicant`, RT tuning). No
desktop, no background daemons stealing cycles — near-bare-metal determinism.
The full startup order is in [`BOOT.md`](BOOT.md).
