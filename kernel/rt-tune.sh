# aloop RT tuning — applied at boot before the audio process starts.
# Every knob here has a WHY; see docs/RT-TUNING.md for the full rationale. The
# goal: worst-case scheduling jitter in the tens of microseconds so 64-sample
# (1.333 ms) audio blocks never miss their deadline (no xruns).

# --- CPU cores ---
# Cores 1 and 3 are the audio cores (home-FX and user-FX). They are isolated
# from the general scheduler via isolcpus=1,3 in cmdline.txt, so only our pinned
# SCHED_FIFO threads run on them. Core 0 = USB I/O, Core 2 = control/network.
AUDIO_CORES="1 3"
CONTROL_CORE="2"

# --- Force max clock, disable power-save that causes latency spikes ---
# WHY: frequency scaling and deep C-states park the CPU and take microseconds to
# wake — enough to blow a 1.333 ms block under load. Pin to performance.
# WITNESSED live on a real Pi 4 (this session): this write was silently a no-op
# every boot -- `cat scaling_governor` on the running device showed `schedutil`
# still active despite `local` (this script's own service) reporting
# `started`. A [diag-gap] instrumentation elsewhere in this codebase showed a
# recurring ~37-41ms stall on the audio thread's per-block read, a magnitude
# consistent with schedutil's own periodic load-sampling/frequency-transition
# work running on the "isolated" cores (isolcpus only removes ordinary
# scheduler-domain tasks, never cpufreq's own kernel-internal governor logic).
# Manually re-running `echo performance > .../scaling_governor` on the booted
# device DID take effect immediately and held -- so the sysfs write mechanism
# itself works; only this boot-time attempt failed. Root cause suspected but
# unconfirmed: the cpufreq driver's sysfs nodes likely don't exist yet this
# early in boot (`local` runs in the `boot` runlevel, before any confirmed
# cpufreq-ready signal), so the glob matched nothing and the whole loop
# silently no-op'd via the `|| true` guard, exactly the kind of failure this
# script's own defensive style masks instead of catching. Fix: retry with a
# bounded wait for the sysfs path to exist, and log a REAL result (not just
# best-effort silence) so a future boot's failure is visible instead of
# invisible.

# --- Disable the kernel's RT throttle on the isolated audio cores ---

# is capped at 95% of any 1-second window, with the remaining 5% reserved for
# non-RT tasks so an RT thread can never fully starve the system. That safety
# net exists for shared cores; cores 1/3 are isolcpus-removed from the general
# scheduler and carry ONLY aloop's own pinned SCHED_FIFO audio threads -- there
# is no other task on those cores this reservation could be protecting.
# WITNESSED live on real Pi 4 hardware: dmesg showing recurring
# "sched: RT throttling activated" correlating with xrun bursts, while
# faustHome.compute() alone already measures ~1.02ms of the 1.333ms block
# budget (~77%) -- close enough to the 95% RT cap that ordinary scheduling
# jitter crosses it and the kernel forcibly pauses the audio thread for the
# rest of that window, which is strictly worse than letting it run.
